# LeetCode Solutions by Sbonfa

## Welcome to the repository where I publish my solutions to LeetCode problems.

All solutions are written primarily in Go and are organized by difficulty into the following categories:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

This repository serves as a way to track my progress and as a resource for others looking for Go implementations of LeetCode problems.

### Structure

    .
    ├── easy
    │   ├── problem_1.go
    │   ├── problem_2.go
    │   └── ...
    ├── medium
    │   ├── problem_101.go
    │   ├── problem_102.go
    │   └── ...
    ├── hard
    │   ├── problem_201.go
    │   ├── problem_202.go
    │   └── ...



Each solution file is named according to the problem number on LeetCode, making it easy to locate specific solutions.

You can clone this repository and browse through the solutions. If you are using Go, you can run the solutions on your local machine:
